#gulpdemo

This is a simple example of gulp that does nothing but print text to console.

To get the sources, create folder with a name e.g. "gulpdemo". Make sure not to give name "gulp" to folder as it is reserved in npm repository.
* open console
* ```git init```
* ```git remote add origin https://github.com/PizzaCodeUA/gulpdemo.git```
* ```git pull origin master```
* ```npm install```
